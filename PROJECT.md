## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm run build           # Production build

# Quality Checks (Must pass!)
npm run quality         # Run all checks
npm run type-check      # TypeScript check
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run test            # Run tests

```

## 🔄 Setup Wizard Management

**After completing setup once:**
- Setup wizard redirects to `/admin` automatically
- To rerun setup, use reset commands below

**Soft Reset** (keeps settings and logs, deletes admin):
```bash
npm run setup:reset
npm run dev
```
Use when: Testing wizard, want to create new admin, keep site settings
